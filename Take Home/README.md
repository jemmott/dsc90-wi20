# DSC90 Take-Home Challenge

## Task:

* Spend up to eight hours, use any tools you want.  Work solo, and don’t use old work (yours or other peoples’).  Don’t look up what other people have done with the data.
* Plan on a fifteen minute presentation with five minutes for questions at the end. Presenting from a notebook is great!  Slides, etc. are ok too.  Audience will be data scientists.
* Explore the data, and come up with some interesting findings.  Some of the datasets have ideas for a task may be included.  These are optional - just for inspiration.
